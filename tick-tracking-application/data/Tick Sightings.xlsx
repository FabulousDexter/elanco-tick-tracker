The `Tick Sightings.xlsx` file is intended to contain tick sighting data. Since you haven't provided specific data to include in the Excel file, I will create a simple structure with example columns that might be relevant for tick sightings. 

Here are the contents for the `data/Tick Sightings.xlsx` file:

- Date
- Location
- Species
- Count

You can create this Excel file using a tool like Excel or programmatically using Python. Below is a representation of how the data might look:

| Date       | Location      | Species   | Count |
|------------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| 2023-01-01 | Forest A      | Ixodes    | 5     |
| 2023-01-02 | Forest B      | Dermacentor| 3    |
| 2023-01-03 | Park C        | Amblyomma | 2     |
| 2023-01-04 | Field D       | Ixodes    | 4     |

You can create the Excel file with this data structure. If you need help with creating the file programmatically, please let me know!
